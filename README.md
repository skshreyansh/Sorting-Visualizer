This visualizer has been using p5.js library in Javasrpit through which one can visualize how different sorting algorithms are performed.

It basically contains basic sorting algorithms as
  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Selection Sort
  3. Insertion Sort
  
To see the working of each of the algorithms one can change the script tag of visualizer to the particular sorting.js file to which one wants to visualize.
